* A way towards a wireless keyboard
A few years ago I got a fascination for mechanical keyboards
through the subreddit  /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Since my main
jobs involves  computers 90 percent  of the time,  I figured
wanted a  custom workhouse  myself; and  so the  rabbit hole
that is mechanical keyboards began.

A few  years ago I  hand-wired two keyboards.  These initial
boards  had  some  nice  features  such  as  mag-like  quick
release,  programmable layouts,  ortholinear layouts  and so
on. Since building those, however, I really wanted something
more portable, and wireless. In addition, I wanted something
more comfortable: queue in this project!

I will set the following goals for this project:
1. The keyboard needs to be wireless
2. The keyboard needs to be split
3. (Optional) rotary encoders 
4. (Optional) screen to display layout information

Prior to  this log, there  was a  V1 with a  custom designed
PCB. Even after  many hours of research  and finally pulling
the  trigger on  ordering the  PCB, the  parts ended  up not
working.  This was  either due  to my  soldering skills,  or
(more likely) my poor PCB design skills. In this V2, I aimed
to   eliminate  most   of  these   issues  by   letting  the
microcontroller  take most  of  the grunt  work. After  some
research I decided on a cheap ESP32 microcontroller with I2C
display and  battery management. The design  was inspired by
cornekeyboard.

* Code progress
The  default  ESP32  firmware  is fairly  complex  and  even
setting up bluetooth is non-trivial for the novice. Luckily,
there  is a  library  written in  C++  (Arduino) that  would
abstract  away  the  details  and allowed  me  to  focus  on
designing the logic involved for the keyboard. As I aimed to
write  the code  in C++,  this was  more of  a bonus  than a
downside. I may  look into the ESP32 firmware  in the future
as I  become more comfortable  with the functions it  has or
when I need them.

The keyboard would need three different aspects
1. Driver for the screen
   a. Display layer info
      a. Scrolling buffer
   b. (Optional) other cool messaging features (?)
2. Driver for the bluetooth
   a. Connection between the two halves
3. Driver for matrix keyboard
   a. Layout switching
   b. Cadet shift keys
   c. (Optional) Macros

First started to figure out the bluetooth and the display as
the keyboard logic itself would build on these two modules.

** Display setup
** DONE Scrolling buffer
When printing output on the screen, the screen may be cut short as it the U8G2 does not perform any bounds checking on what's being drawn on the screen. Luckily, for text the library is extended to enable scrolling buffers. To enable  this, the display class has to be extended through the U8G2LOG class. In a nutshell, this class tiles the display space according to rectangular spaces and draws the characters in those tiles. Monospace  fonts are
preferred here as letters are all the same size. The framebuffer has to be set according to what font size is used, such that the characters are set to the correct space.

As it currently stands, the framebuffers has to be manually resized when fontsize changes. I haven't finalized any designs yet on the GUI. Consequently, I have added a separate size function that will automate the bookkeeping.

** TODO Designing a UI
*** What should it display?
- Battery information(!)
- Layer information
- Messages through wifi
  + Perhaps not possible as wifi and  ble operate through the same antenna. With
    latest idf it should be possible and interferes with the pin choice
* PCB design
Most of this is done, but needs to be documented
** TODO add power button on layout
* Bluetooth setup
** DONE setup HID for BLE
** DONE Send keys by connecting a key
** Server client setup
https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/esp32-ble-client-connecting-to-fitness-band-to-trigger-light
Running two bluetooth instances separately is not wanted due to
1. High power consumption; two devices running the a full bluetooth client is expensive.
2. Communication; some  keys may require coordination among 2  halves before sent
   to the computer.

The esp32 supports energy efficient  communication among server-client setup. In
the keyboard one half will be setup as the server and the other as a client. The
server will communicate with the main device and will be recognized as hid.

*** Generic Attributes (GATT)
Communication between server  and client happens through GATT;  this defines how
the  server  and  client  exchange  messages.   The  structure  of  of  GATT  is
hierarchical. In brief, the hierarchy looks as follows:

1. Service
   a. UUID
   b. Characteristic
      a. Descriptor (UUID)
      b. Value
   c. (other service)

At the top of the hierarchy is a profile which holds one or more services. Every
service contains at least one characteristic, or can reference other services. A
service is a collection of information,  such as a sensor reading, battery level
reading and so on.  There are some pre-defined services that  can be called (see
https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/services).

The BLE  characteristic is  owned by  a service  and is  the place  where actual
information is  held in the  hierarchy. The  characteristic consists of  (1) the
characteristic declaration, and (2) the characteristic value. The characteristic
may be  expanded by descriptors which  further expand the metadata  contained in
the  characteristic   declaration.  These  characteristic  may   have  different
properties such as read-write, broadcast, write without response and so on.

Each service needs  a universally unique identifier (UUID) which  is a 128-bit (16
byte) unique string of numbers and letters.

In the case of the BLEKeyboard library, the main class holds 3 characteristics

1. inputKeyboard
2. outputKeyboard
3. inputMediaKeys


** vTaskCreate
Implementing tasks  on the esp32. These  functions run as an  infinite loop. The
BLEKeyboard firmware creates a server in the `this->taskServer` and binds it in `begin`.
   - minor notes; i think  i need to add stuff to the  ble connection status. It
     needs to change from server to client and the way it interacts

** TODO figure out the three callback arrays
The callback  class merely has logging  functions but it inherents  from a class
that has callbacks

** TODO look at blehiddevice class

* Keyboard firmware
** TODO setting up keyboard layouts
** DONE Matrix scanning

* Display firmware
** Updating the display is slow
- [ ] perhaps move the updating f the display into a
  ring buffer type setup
** TODO create text class
Take into account screen size and adjusts text accordingly
** DONE move log into display class
** TODO write functions for dealing with font sizes and automatic log update
if the font is changed; the  frameBuffer may be overwritten causing the firmware
crash. This needs to be fixed.
** DONE Show layer info
* TODO There shall be light!
There are two  main programs one can  use for arduino and LEDs.  The most common
ones are  FastLED and  NeoPixel. Unfortunately, the  LEDS I  bought are
SK6812 ([[https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/1138/SK6812+LED+datasheet+.pdf][datasheet]]) which both libraries don't support. Luckily, somebody already
did the grunt work in converting the NeoPixel library to support this LED type.


The class SK6182Serial implies that the LEDs are adressed through two buffers:
- frameBuffer : buffer used for driving the leds
- drawBuffer : attachment  to framebuffers. This buffer holds the  state that is
  going to  be drawn in the  frame buffer after update;  it is what is  set when
  setting colors of pixels.

  The initializiation reads as:
#+begin_src cpp
    constexpr SK6182Serial(uint16_t num, void *fb, void *db, uint8_t pin,
                           uint8_t cfg)
        : numled(num), pin(pin), config(cfg), frameBuffer((uint8_t *)fb),
          drawBuffer((uint8_t *)db) {}
    bool begin();
#+end_src

`num` refers to the number of leds in the entire frameBuffer.
* Esp32 pin information
- Finalize pin design
- Not all pins can be used for a  all inputs, for example 34 and higher can only
  be used a input pins
 - Touch pins can be used to wake from sleep.
  + Perhaps use a rotary encoder to wake from sleep
  + Not sure if you can use a pin at all for this purpose as it probably neds to
    connect ground
- What pins to use for waking from sleep?
