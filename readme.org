* Introduction
Mechanical keyboards  are somewhat  of a dated  concept that
has  gathered some  speed in  more recent  years. Back  when
computers were  first coming  out for the  public, keyboards
had  mechanical connections  that would  allow a  current to
activate a  switch. Then as  economics got wind,  somehow we
got used  to membrane  keyboards; virtually every  office in
the  world   has  these  membrane  keyboards.   Compared  to
mechanical keyboards, membrane  keyboards feel more "mushy".
In contrast,  mechanical keyboards  may have  different feel
based  on  the  springs  or  whether the  key  switch  has  a
noticeable  "bump".   They  can   be  clicky  or   not;  the
possibility are wild now.

A  few  years  ago  I started  following  the  subreddit  on
mechanical keyboards.  Back then,  the community  had little
options and cherry still had patents on the switches. Cherry
MX keys were virtually found in every commercial keyboard on
the market. Now,  the landscape has changed quite  a bit and
more and more different types of switches are available.

Why do  I prefer mechanical keyboards?  Mechanical keyboards
give a "joy" to typing.  Membrane keyboards are fine to type
on, but  they aren't fun.  Generally my fingers  get "tired"
after typing  on membrane keyboards  as the keys feel  a bit
mushy, i.e.  you get no relief  when pushing down a  key and
the key press does not feel crisp.

After  following  ~/r~/ mechanicalkeyboards   for  a  while,  I
decided to  /build/ my  own keyboard. Within  the community,
there is a wide variety  of switches and shapes of keyboards
available. The one I wanted, an orthonormal keyboard, wasn't
commercially available. Plus I liked the idea of building my
own keyboard.  In my work,  the keyboard is my  primary tool
and why not  key a custom version of it  for myself. I ended
up  building 2  handwired  versions of  65  percent with  85
switches  in  a  grid  layout.   In  addition,  I  modded  a
MagSafe-inspired cable to it which allowed it to be nice and
portable. After  every build I told  myself : " This  is the
last one I'll build".

Enter  this blog,  where I  again tell  myself "this  is the
last  one I  build!". What  changed? Since  I learned  about
split-style keyboard,  I always wanted one.  The keyboards I
had  made   so  far  weren't.  Split   would  be  completely
ergonomical,  but  unfortunately,  none (that  I  know  of)
exists that are both (a) wireless and (b) split. As always
I aimed to high and wanted to emulate the many features that
QMK implements. Most importantly, I  wanted to get back into
writing more low  level languages like c++, and  I take this
project as  a nice  opportunity to get  into c++  again, and
work with micro-controllers.

This post  will serve as  my log for building  the keyboard.
The post will updated as I work on it.

Core feature targets
- Split _wireless_ keyboard
- Hot swappable key switches
- Portable: not a full keyboard
- Battery control
- OLED display
- Rotary encoders

* Outline
The keyboard is split; it has two halves. The right and left
half will have  most of the same  "base" functionality. Most
importantly, each  half needs to  scan the matrix  to obtain
which keys are being pressed. One of the halves will act as a
server, the other will act as a client. The server will need
the following capabilities

Server abilities
- Read matrix
- Setup a bluetooth connection
  + HID Device
  + Mouse emulation
- Setup connection with client
  + Merge keys pressed and send to bluetooth controller
- Control LEDs on both client and server

Client abilities
- Read matrix
- Find server and send pressed keys to server

Due to the heavier load of  the server, I prefer to make the
role of  who is server and  who is client dynamic.  That is,
with some heuristic (for example  deep sleep), the roles may
switch to prolong batter life of both units.
