* Welcome to Splitboard

#+html: <p align="center"><img src="figures/logo_firmware.svg" /></p>

Keyboard firmware written for the  esp32. I wanted to have a
bluetooth  split  keyboard  for  a while  so  I  wrote  this
firmware. The software takes  heavy inspiration from the [[https://docs.qmk.fm/#/][QMK
firmware]], and was developed using Platformio.

* Features
** Board features
- [-] Fully programmable split keyboard
  - [-] Bluetooth support
  - [-] Split bidirectional communication over esp_now
    - [X] Current support 2 elements
    - [ ] Dynamic  mesh  feature (connect  arbitrary units  in
      neighborhood, e.g. numpad)
- [X] Layer support (up to 16 layers)
- [X] LED support through [[https://github.com/FastLED][FastLED]]
- [X] OLED support through [[https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2][U8G2]]
- [X] Rotary encoder support
** Special keys
- [X] Mod tap keys: mod when held, keycode when tapped
  - [X] Space cadet keys
    - Shift when tapped, shift was modifier.
- [X] Layer tap functionality
- [ ] One tap modifier keys
  + Tap for keycode, hold for layer switch
- [ ] Leader key
- [ ] Macro support

  
* Instructions
This firmware was  developed for [[https://github.com/cvanelteren/Elanor][Elanor]] which  uses a farely
basic  setup  of 27  keys  +  1 rotary  encoder  (optional).
Adaptations can be made to the setup and configurations are set
in [[file:./src/config.hpp]].

* History
I     documented     the     design     process     (partly)
[[https://cvanelteren.github.io/post/splitboard/][here]] for those that are interested.
